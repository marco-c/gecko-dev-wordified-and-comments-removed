Protocol
subclass
implementing
the
data
transfer
phase
.
    
Once
the
WebSocket
connection
is
established
during
the
data
transfer
    
phase
the
protocol
is
almost
symmetrical
between
the
server
side
and
the
    
client
side
.
:
class
:
WebSocketCommonProtocol
implements
logic
that
'
s
    
shared
between
servers
and
clients
.
.
    
Subclasses
such
as
:
class
:
~
websockets
.
server
.
WebSocketServerProtocol
and
    
:
class
:
~
websockets
.
client
.
WebSocketClientProtocol
implement
the
opening
    
handshake
which
is
different
between
servers
and
clients
.
    
:
class
:
WebSocketCommonProtocol
performs
four
functions
:
    
*
It
runs
a
task
that
stores
incoming
data
frames
in
a
queue
and
makes
      
them
available
with
the
:
meth
:
recv
coroutine
.
    
*
It
sends
outgoing
data
frames
with
the
:
meth
:
send
coroutine
.
    
*
It
deals
with
control
frames
automatically
.
    
*
It
performs
the
closing
handshake
.
    
:
class
:
WebSocketCommonProtocol
supports
asynchronous
iteration
:
:
        
async
for
message
in
websocket
:
            
await
process
(
message
)
    
The
iterator
yields
incoming
messages
.
It
exits
normally
when
the
    
connection
is
closed
with
the
close
code
1000
(
OK
)
or
1001
(
going
away
)
.
    
It
raises
a
:
exc
:
~
websockets
.
exceptions
.
ConnectionClosedError
exception
    
when
the
connection
is
closed
with
any
other
code
.
    
Once
the
connection
is
open
a
Ping
frame
_
is
sent
every
    
ping_interval
seconds
.
This
serves
as
a
keepalive
.
It
helps
keeping
    
the
connection
open
especially
in
the
presence
of
proxies
with
short
    
timeouts
on
inactive
connections
.
Set
ping_interval
to
None
to
    
disable
this
behavior
.

If
the
corresponding
Pong
frame
_
isn
'
t
received
within
ping_timeout
    
seconds
the
connection
is
considered
unusable
and
is
closed
with
    
code
1011
.
This
ensures
that
the
remote
endpoint
remains
responsive
.
Set
    
ping_timeout
to
None
to
disable
this
behavior

The
close_timeout
parameter
defines
a
maximum
wait
time
in
seconds
for
    
completing
the
closing
handshake
and
terminating
the
TCP
connection
.
    
:
meth
:
close
completes
in
at
most
4
*
close_timeout
on
the
server
    
side
and
5
*
close_timeout
on
the
client
side
.
    
close_timeout
needs
to
be
a
parameter
of
the
protocol
because
    
websockets
usually
calls
:
meth
:
close
implicitly
:
    
-
on
the
server
side
when
the
connection
handler
terminates
    
-
on
the
client
side
when
exiting
the
context
manager
for
the
connection
.
    
To
apply
a
timeout
to
any
other
API
wrap
it
in
:
func
:
~
asyncio
.
wait_for
.
    
The
max_size
parameter
enforces
the
maximum
size
for
incoming
messages
    
in
bytes
.
The
default
value
is
1
MiB
.
None
disables
the
limit
.
If
a
    
message
larger
than
the
maximum
size
is
received
:
meth
:
recv
will
    
raise
:
exc
:
~
websockets
.
exceptions
.
ConnectionClosedError
and
the
    
connection
will
be
closed
with
code
1009
.
    
The
max_queue
parameter
sets
the
maximum
length
of
the
queue
that
    
holds
incoming
messages
.
The
default
value
is
32
.
None
disables
    
the
limit
.
Messages
are
added
to
an
in
-
memory
queue
when
they
'
re
received
;
    
then
:
meth
:
recv
pops
from
that
queue
.
In
order
to
prevent
excessive
    
memory
consumption
when
messages
are
received
faster
than
they
can
be
    
processed
the
queue
must
be
bounded
.
If
the
queue
fills
up
the
protocol
    
stops
processing
incoming
data
until
:
meth
:
recv
is
called
.
In
this
    
situation
various
receive
buffers
(
at
least
in
asyncio
and
in
the
OS
)
    
will
fill
up
then
the
TCP
receive
window
will
shrink
slowing
down
    
transmission
to
avoid
packet
loss
.
    
Since
Python
can
use
up
to
4
bytes
of
memory
to
represent
a
single
    
character
each
connection
may
use
up
to
4
*
max_size
*
max_queue
    
bytes
of
memory
to
store
incoming
messages
.
By
default
this
is
128
MiB
.
    
You
may
want
to
lower
the
limits
depending
on
your
application
'
s
    
requirements
.
    
The
read_limit
argument
sets
the
high
-
water
limit
of
the
buffer
for
    
incoming
bytes
.
The
low
-
water
limit
is
half
the
high
-
water
limit
.
The
    
default
value
is
64
KiB
half
of
asyncio
'
s
default
(
based
on
the
current
    
implementation
of
:
class
:
~
asyncio
.
StreamReader
)
.
    
The
write_limit
argument
sets
the
high
-
water
limit
of
the
buffer
for
    
outgoing
bytes
.
The
low
-
water
limit
is
a
quarter
of
the
high
-
water
limit
.
    
The
default
value
is
64
KiB
equal
to
asyncio
'
s
default
(
based
on
the
    
current
implementation
of
FlowControlMixin
)
.
    
As
soon
as
the
HTTP
request
and
response
in
the
opening
handshake
are
    
processed
:
    
*
the
request
path
is
available
in
the
:
attr
:
path
attribute
;
    
*
the
request
and
response
HTTP
headers
are
available
in
the
      
:
attr
:
request_headers
and
:
attr
:
response_headers
attributes
      
which
are
:

.

instances
.
    
If
a
subprotocol
was
negotiated
it
'
s
available
in
the
:
attr
:

attribute
.
    
Once
the
connection
is
closed
the
code
is
available
in
the
    
:
attr
:
close_code
attribute
and
the
reason
in
:

:

.
    
All
these
attributes
must
be

as

Close
the
transport
after
receiving
EOF
.
        
The
WebSocket
protocol
has
its
own
closing
handshake
:
endpoints
close
        
the
TCP
or
TLS
connection
after
sending
and
receiving
a
close
frame
.
        
As
a
consequence
they
never
need
to
write
after
receiving
EOF
so
        
there
'
s
no
reason
to
keep
the
transport
open
by
returning
True
.
        
Besides
that
doesn
'
t
work
on
TLS
connections
