This
example
code
fragment
demonstrates
how
to
set
up
a
HTTP
/
2
server
that
uses
the
plaintext
HTTP
Upgrade
mechanism
to
negotiate
HTTP
/
2
connectivity
.
For
maximum
explanatory
value
it
uses
the
synchronous
socket
API
that
comes
with
the
Python
standard
library
.
In
product
code
you
will
want
to
use
an
actual
HTTP
/
1
.
1
server
library
if
possible
.
This
code
requires
Python
3
.
5
or
later
.

How
it
works

very
