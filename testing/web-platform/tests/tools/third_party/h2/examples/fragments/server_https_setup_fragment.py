This
example
code
fragment
demonstrates
how
to
set
up
a
HTTP
/
2
server
that
negotiates
HTTP
/
2
using
NPN
and
ALPN
.
For
the
sake
of
maximum
explanatory
value
this
code
uses
the
synchronous
low
-
level
sockets
API
:
however
if
you
'
re
not
using
sockets
directly
(
e
.
g
.
because
you
'
re
using
asyncio
)
you
should
focus
on
the
set
up
required
for
the
SSLContext
object
.
For
other
concurrency
libraries
you
may
need
to
use
other
setup
(
e
.
g
.
for
Twisted
you
'
ll
need
to
use
IProtocolNegotiationFactory
)
.
This
code
requires
Python
3
.
5
or
later
.
