This
test
checks
that
when
the
root
element
has
a
&
lt
;
body
&
gt
;
child
element
then
the
principal
writing
mode
is
instead
taken
from
the
values
of
writing
-
mode
and
direction
on
the
first
such
child
element
instead
of
taken
from
the
root
element
.
Also
a
small
script
in
this
test
verifies
that
the
computed
value
of
'
writing
-
mode
'
of
the
root
element
itself
is
not
affected
by
such
propagation
.
We
also
check
that
the
computed
value
is
unaffected
by
inheriting
it
into
a
pseudo
element
.
