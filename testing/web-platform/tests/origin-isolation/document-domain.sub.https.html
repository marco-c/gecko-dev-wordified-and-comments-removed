Normally
setting
document
.
domain
to
itself
would
change
the
domain
/
/
component
of
the
origin
.
Since
the
iframe
does
*
not
*
set
document
.
domain
/
/
the
two
would
then
be
considered
cross
-
origin
.
document
.
domain
=
document
.
domain
;
/
/
However
because
we
'
re
using
origin
isolation
this
shouldn
'
t
have
any
/
/
impact
.
The
test
fails
if
this
throws
and
passes
if
it
succeeds
