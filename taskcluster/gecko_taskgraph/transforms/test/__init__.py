These
transforms
construct
a
task
description
to
run
the
given
test
based
on
a
test
description
.
The
implementation
here
is
shared
among
all
test
kinds
but
contains
specific
support
for
how
we
run
tests
in
Gecko
(
via
mozharness
invoked
in
particular
ways
)
.
This
is
a
good
place
to
translate
a
test
-
description
option
such
as
single
-
core
:
true
to
the
implementation
of
that
option
in
a
task
description
(
worker
options
mozharness
commandline
environment
variables
etc
.
)
The
test
description
should
be
fully
formed
by
the
time
it
reaches
these
transforms
and
these
transforms
should
not
embody
any
specific
knowledge
about
what
should
run
where
.
this
is
the
wrong
place
for
special
-
casing
platforms
for
example
-
use
all_tests
.
py
instead
.
