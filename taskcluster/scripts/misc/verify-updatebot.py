The
purpose
of
this
job
is
to
run
on
autoland
and
ensure
that
any
commits
made
by
the
Updatebot
bot
account
are
reproducible
.
Patches
that
aren
'
t
reproducible
indicate
some
sort
of
error
in
this
script
or
represent
concerns
about
the
integrity
of
the
patch
made
by
Updatebot
.
More
simply
:
If
this
job
fails
any
patches
by
Updatebot
SHOULD
NOT
land
             
because
they
may
represent
a
security
indicent
.

This
indicates
that
the
mercurial
repositories
may
not
be
operating
in
an
expected
way
and
a
script
that
performs
security
checks
may
fail
to
perform
them
properly
.
Sheriffs
:
This
_does
not_
mean
the
changesets
involved
need
to
be
backed
out
.
You
can
continue
with
your
usual
operation
.
However
;
if
this
occurs
during
a
mercurial
upgrade
or
a
refactring
of
how
we
treat
try
/
autoland
or
the
landing
process
it
means
that
we
need
to
revisit
the
operation
of
this
script
.
For
now
we
ask
that
you
file
a
bug
blocking
1618282
indicating
the
task
failed
so
we
can
investigate
the
circumstances
that
caused
it
to
fail
.
