Check
that
the
current
sourcemap
and
worker
bundles
built
for
DevTools
are
up
to
date
.
This
job
should
fail
if
any
file
impacting
the
bundle
creation
was
modified
without
regenerating
the
bundles
.
This
check
should
be
run
after
building
the
bundles
via
:
cd
devtools
/
client
/
debugger
yarn
&
&
node
bin
/
bundle
.
js
Those
steps
are
done
in
the
devtools
-
verify
-
bundle
job
prior
to
calling
this
script
.
The
script
will
only
run
hg
status
devtools
/
and
check
that
no
change
is
detected
by
mercurial
