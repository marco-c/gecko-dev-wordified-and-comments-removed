Container

Each
transform
is
represented
as
a
    
callable
taking
(

and
returning
a
generator
which
will
yield
    
transformed
items

The
resulting
sequence
has
the

This
is
convenient
to
use
in
a

full
of
transforms
as
it
provides
a
    
decorator
transforms

add
that
will
add
the

function
to
the
