The
objective
of
optimization
is
to
remove
as
many
tasks
from
the
graph
as
possible
as
efficiently
as
possible
thereby
delivering
useful
results
as
quickly
as
possible
.
For
example
ideally
if
only
a
test
script
is
modified
in
a
push
then
the
resulting
graph
contains
only
the
corresponding
test
suite
task
.
See
taskcluster
/
docs
/
optimization

for
