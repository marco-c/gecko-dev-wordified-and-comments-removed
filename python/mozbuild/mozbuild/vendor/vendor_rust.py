Take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
cargo
will
treat
lines
starting
with

#
as
comments
to
add
preprocessing
directives
.
This

thus

{

#
define

{

#
We
explicitly
exclude
the
following
section
when
preprocessing
because
#
it
would
overlap
with
the
preprocessed

#
Thankfully
REPLACE_NAME
is
unlikely
to
be
