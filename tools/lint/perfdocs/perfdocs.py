Build
up
performance
testing
documentation
dynamically
by
combining
    
text
data
from
YAML
files
that
reside
in
perfdoc
folders
    
across
the
testing
directory
.
Each
directory
is
expected
to
have
    
an
index
.
rst
file
along
with
config
.
yml
YAMLs
defining
what
needs
    
to
be
added
to
the
documentation
.
    
The
YAML
must
also
define
the
name
of
the
"
framework
"
that
should
be
    
used
in
the
main
index
.
rst
for
the
performance
testing
documentation
.
    
The
testing
documentation
list
will
be
ordered
alphabetically
once
    
it
'
s
produced
(
to
avoid
unwanted
shifts
because
of
unordered
dicts
    
and
path
searching
)
.
    
Note
that
the
suite
name
headings
will
be
given
the
H4
(
-
-
-
)
style
so
it
    
is
suggested
that
you
use
H3
(
=
=

)
style
as
the
heading
for
your
    
test
section
.
H5
will
be
used
be
used
for
individual
tests
within
each
